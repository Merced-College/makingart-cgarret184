Answers to the reflection: 
1. My group and I chose to do option A.
2. We used an array at the top of main, with it storing colors for red, green, and blue. 
3. Everything changed: from the backround, to the lines drawing the mandelbrot, and the inner colors of the mandelbrot itself. 
    It looks very trippy and fractal!
4. I used AI to assist with making mapping iter to a palette index, but one common issue I ran into is that the mandelbrot would commonly
    show up as a white backround with no lines at all. Due to this, I had to troubleshoot the AI and the code a fair amount until we were able to finally get the iteration working with the palette index.
